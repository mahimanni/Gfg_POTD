/*
Given a string representation of a decimal number s, check whether it is divisible by 8.

Example 1:
Input:
s = "16"
Output:
1
Explanation:
The given number is divisible by 8,
so the driver code prints 1 as the output.

Example 2:
Input:
s = "54141111648421214584416464555"
Output:
-1
Explanation:
Given Number is not divisible by 8, 
so the driver code prints -1 as the output.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1).
Expected Auxillary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= Number represented by the string s <= 106
